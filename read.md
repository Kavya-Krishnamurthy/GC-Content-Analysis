**GC Content Analysis of DNA Sequences**
Objective : Calculate the GC content of DNA sequences and visualize the results.

GC Content Analysis of DNA Sequences refers to calculating the percentage of guanine (G)and cytosine (C)bases in a DNA sequence.

- GC Content
GC content is the proportion of Guanine (G)and Cytosine (C)bases in a DNA sequence, expressed as a percentage of the total nucleotides.

- Why is GC Content Important?
 1. Genomic Stability– High GC content makes DNA more stable due to stronger hydrogen bonds(G-C has threebonds vs. A-T’s two).
 2. Species Identification– Different organisms have unique GC content percentages.
 3. PCR & Sequencing– GC content affects melting temperature (Tm)and efficiency of PCR amplification.
 4. Gene Regulation– GC-rich regions like CpG islandsare often associated with gene regulation.

- Example
For a DNA sequence ATGCGATC, the GC content is calculated as:
 • G = 2, C = 2
 • Total bases = 8
 • GC% = (2+2) / 8 × 100 = 50%
